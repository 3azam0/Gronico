They have a size of approx. 0.5mm. Trichogramma brassicae is a so called parasitoid of eggs. It means that it lays its eggs into the egg of a host (e.g. in the eggs of borers), and as a result the host is killed during development of the parasitoid inside the host egg. Applying large numbers of Trichogramma in the maize field, a large proportion of Lepidoptera eggs is parasitized by Trichogramma females and thus killed."
