It means that it lays its eggs into the egg of a host (e.g. in the eggs of borers), and as a result the host is killed during development of the parasitoid inside the host egg. Applying large numbers of Trichogramma in the maize field, a large proportion of Lepidoptera eggs is parasitized by Trichogramma females and thus killed."

The eggs are parasitized by Trichogramma. Development of Trichogramma in the egg inhibits the growth of Lepidoptera: instead of Lepidoptera larvae, Trichogramma (2. Generation) will hatch and the cycle starts again If the development process of Lepidoptera is not interrupted, larvae hatch after 4-9 days and feed on the corn cobs and stalks, and then they pupate at the bottom of the stalk. Lepidoptera hatches out of the pupa and starts laying new egg masses into the field"
