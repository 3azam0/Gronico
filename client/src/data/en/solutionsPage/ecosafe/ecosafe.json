                    "content": "Most agricultural pests have a winged or flying stage at some point in their life cycle. For example, the small aphid-like Phylloxera is one of the most destructive grape pests worldwide with a complex life cycle that often involves a winged stage in the spring, summer or fall. By killing these pests in the flying stage -before they can lay their eggs – the Phylloxera’s life cycle is broken. The light traps take advantage of that most insects are sensitive to light and wish to approach light places at night. According to scientific studies, different insects are attracted to different wavelengths and frequencies of light. This is the scientific basis of our ECOSAFE product."
